The additional functionality added by Riki:

The algorithm can be performed with one of the following options:
=> firstIterationScores: This decoding method tests the best tree accorsing to the u value calculated by ilan's algorithm in the first iteration.
			after calculating the new scores we run ChuLiuEdmonds algorithm.
			performance:
				-) from the sample input trainign and testing: slower& more accurate when using in the testing, while ilan's minLoss is being used in the training phase.
=> firstIterationBuildGreedy: more accurate. still not fast enough.
